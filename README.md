## This is a beginner project in python

### A CLI task tracker

- List all tasks (task-cli list)
- Add task (task-cli add 'Watch football')
- Update task (task-cli update {todo id - 1} 'Watch news instead' )
- Delete task (task-cli delete {todo id - 1})
- Mark task as in-progress (task-cli mark-in-progress {todo id - 1})
- Mark task as done (task-cli mark-done {todo id - 1})
- List tasks by status (task-cli list done or task-cli list in-progress or task-cli list todo)

Mine own version of it
